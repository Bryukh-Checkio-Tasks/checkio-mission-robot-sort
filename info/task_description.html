    The spaceship reactors contains several energy nuclear rods.
    These rods should be sorted by size for stable reactor working.
    But as usual the stupid reactor serving machine had placed all nuclear rods without any order and started the engine.
    Now Stephan have to reorder all rods.
    Because the reactor is working already he can only quick swap neighbour rods.

    You are given sizes and the initial order of rods as an array of numbers. Indexes are position, values are sizes.
    You should order this array from the lowest to the biggest sizes.
